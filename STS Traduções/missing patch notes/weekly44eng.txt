Hello!

This week brings a few more daily mods, several bug fixes, and we worked with a few people to update the wording for many many cards, relics, and powers. Also, some content is still planned to come into beta this month :).

[h1]Daily Mods[/h1]

This week brings 3 new daily mods! Combined with last week's mods, we think this brings in quite a lot more variety into Daily Climbs and more options for Custom Mode.

[h1]Wording Improvements[/h1]
So this will be a bit of a long one. We received a huge list of suggestions and feedback pointing out inconsistencies and potential improvements to wording. While it would be hilarious to list them all out, listing out the general rules and  style changes would probably be best for all of us. So here it goes:
[list]
[*]Cards, Powers, and Relics that have a recurring effect or applies a recurring buff have been changed from "At the start of your turn" -> "At the start of each turn" for clarification.
[*]The term "attack damage" is now lowercase, this differentiates it better from Attacks, which refers to the card.
[*]Attack and Skill cards are referred to as Attacks and Skills in descriptions. However, when referring to a specific card, cards of a specific color, cards of a specific rarity, or specific types that aren't Attacks or Skills, they now have the word "card" appended to the end. e.g. Power cards, Status cards, Colorless cards, Uncommon cards.
[*]Keywords are now always gold in descriptions. Block, Vulnerable, etc.
[*]Boss and Elite are now capitalized in any descriptions
[*]Card, Cards, Relic, Relics, Buffs, and Debuffs are now lowercase and not colored in descriptions.
[*]If a relic that has counters is used up, it now has a consistent message across all relics, "This relic is used up."
[*]Certain keywords on cards are now ordered so they're easier to identify. This order is: Unplayable > Innate > Ethereal > Card Description > Exhaust.
[*]The word "all" is all-caps in certain scenarios. These scenarios are: When it refers to all enemies and when referring to cards that are outside of your hand (Apotheosis).
[*]Updated instances of "take damage" vs "receive damage" based on who the target is, how the description is formed (condition vs effect), and a few special cases. e.g. "Whenever you receive damage, do X." is now common for player Powers and Relics.
[*]Draw Pile, Exhaust Pile, Deck, and Discard Pile are now lowercase in descriptions.
[*]Numbers and percentages should always be blue when seen in power and relic descriptions. However, numerical multipliers like twice and double should not be.
[/list]

While we understand that the language on these items won't ever be perfect, we hope this improves clarity and readability so the game is easier to play. As always, we welcome feedback and discussion!
