Hey everyone,

Breaks are good. But patches are good, too!
This patch brings in updates for our older low-res Power icons, additional SFX, and bug fixes.

[h1]Power Icon Updates[/h1]
The newer icons are higher resolution and some have been reworked for clarity.
Here's a packed texture showing off all of our power icons!
