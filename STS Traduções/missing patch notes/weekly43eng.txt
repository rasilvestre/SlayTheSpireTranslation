Hello!

We're introducing some new mods for the Daily Climb this week (and next week, too). There's also good progress going on  other content which we're on track to get into beta sometime in October.

[h1]Daily Mods[/h1]
We're cleaning, changing, and adding more for Daily Climbs! There's still a few missing assets for the new daily mods but they'll be in soon. The many mods added to the Daily Climb are also accessible via Custom Mode.
